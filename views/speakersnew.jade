I will challenge the Northwestern community to consider abandoning the civil rights framework in order to reach back and get the human rights framework."

Unfortunately, the 'scientific' methods employed these sites are fundamentally flawed. But scientific and technological innovations are converging, opening the door to a completely new approach to matchmaking algorithms."

But we experience our greatest personal growth when our paths cross into the unknown and unfamiliar. Perhaps the ‘wolves in the woods’ are merely self-imposed mental hurdles that keep us from discovering our true potential."

My talk will discuss the hidden compatibilities and opportunities for forward progression that culture and human rights pose if we think of them in a new light."
